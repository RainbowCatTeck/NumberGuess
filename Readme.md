**Objective:**
Create a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number within a range (for example, 1 to 100), and the player has to guess the number.

**Tasks:**

1. **Task 1 - Setup the Game:**
   - Generate a random number within a range.
   - Initialize the number of attempts the player has to guess the number.

2. **Task 2 - Player Input:**
   - Prompt the player to enter a guess.
   - Check if the input is a valid number within the range.

3. **Task 3 - Game Logic:**
   - Compare the player's guess with the random number.
   - If the guess is correct, congratulate the player and end the game.
   - If the guess is too high or too low, give the player a hint and let them guess again.
   - Decrease the number of attempts after each guess.

4. **Task 4 - Game Over:**
   - If the player guesses the number correctly or uses up all their attempts, the game ends.
   - Ask the player if they want to play again.

5. **Task 5 - Error Handling:**
   - Handle any potential errors in the game, such as invalid input from the player.

Remember, the key to building a project is to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. Start with the basic functionality first, then you can add more features like score keeping, difficulty levels, or a graphical user interface. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š~~S~~
